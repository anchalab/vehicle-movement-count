# Vehicle Movement Count

Traffic movement count refers to the process of quantifying vehicle flows between defined entry and exit points‚Äîcalled gates‚Äîat an intersection. Each vehicle‚Äôs trajectory is tracked from its entry gate to its exit gate, and the system tallies how many vehicles move from one gate to another (e.g., from Gate 1 to Gate 3).

A Shiny dashboard has been developed to simplify this process. It takes an intersection image and vehicle trajectory data as input, automatically detects gates, and calculates the count of vehicles for each gate-to-gate movement. Users can then map real-world directions (e.g., North, East) to the detected gates, allowing the dashboard to generate directional traffic counts. This intuitive interface enables users to visualize traffic flow patterns and export results for further analysis‚Äîmaking it a practical tool for traffic engineers and planners.
